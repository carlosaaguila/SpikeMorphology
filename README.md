Spike Morphology project

This is the codebase for the project using interictal spike EEG data to diagnose mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) 
vs. other types. Here we describe steps to begin with a dataset containing electrode contact-level features and 
calculate mesial-to-lateral spread patterns. Additionally, code to perform univariate analysis across features 
and initializing machine learning models to predict mTLE is included.


To run the analysis, follow these steps:
1) Download the codebase from:
   https://github.com/penn-cnt/IEEG_Spike-Morphology/
2) Download the datasets from:
   XXX
3) Upload your ieeg.org username and password file in the tools folder.
   Put this file in the "tools" folder
